  The modern Syriac script is used today by Assyrian writers of the
  neo-Aramaic language. This Romanization System may be applied to any
  toponyms written in this script as may be encountered in parts of
  northern Iraq, Syria, northern Iran and eastern Turkey. The Neo-Aramaic
  language has a degree of locally official status within Iraq, and
  accordingly some bilingual Arabic and modern Syriac signage may be
  encountered.

  The script is closely aligned to that of both Hebrew and Arabic, and,
  as these, is written from right to left. In this Romanization System,
  ‘strong’ consonants have been marked with a sub-dot so as not to give a
  closer visual relation to either Arabic (which marks such consonants
  with a cedilla) or Hebrew (which marks these with an underbar). The
  equivalences where they exist in the Arabic and Hebrew scripts have
  also been shown only for a guide to the cognate root.

notes:
  - Letters connect to the following letter (to the left) except those
    referenced to this note.

    This is the form in independent or word-final position. The form
    initially and medially differs but this is not included in a standalone
    form in the Unicode Standard. The initial/medial form will however be
    automatically generated in using the letter’s Unicode encoding
    initially or medially in a word. To illustrate the different forms,
    using the Unicode encoding twice gives: '\u071F'; '\u0721'; and '\u0722'

    Ālap (ܐ) has a number of functions in modern Syriac script:

    * It appears word-initially to denote a vowel, and is sometimes
      followed by yōd or wāw to denote ī or ū respectively.
    * It appears word-medially to denote what historically was a
      glottal stop. It is understood that this does not now function as a
      ‘stop’ in speech, though the Ālap still appears in the written form.
      This is romanized '.'.
    * It appears word-medially to denote a long vowel ā or ē.
    * It appears word-finally to denote the long vowel ā or ē.

    Given the ambiguity in its function, it is recommended that a
    reference source be consulted for further guidance as to the
    appropriate romanization.

  - Taw (ܬ) should be romanized t when unaspirated, and th when
    aspirated. A reference source should be consulted for further guidance
    as to the appropriate romanization.

    Numerals in modern Syriac script are represented by letters of the
    alphabet: Ālap, Bēt, Gāmal = 1, 2, 3 etc.; Yōd = 10, Kāp = 20, Lāmad =
    30 etc.; Qōp = 100, Rēsh = 200, Shīn = 300 and finally Taw = 400.
    Unlike Arabic, composite numerals are written from right-toleft, so for
    instance 12 is written ܒ ܝ . Given the limited number of
    single-character numerals, other numbers are naturally quite
    elaborately composed: for instance, 999 may be written as (90×10)+90+9
    or as 400+400+100+90+9. Arabic numerals are also used.

    An inventory of letter-diacritic combinations, with their Unicode
    encoding, in addition to the unmodified letters of the basic Roman
    script is:

    ’ (U+2019) , ‘ (U+2018)
    Ā (U+0100) , ā (U+0101)
    Ē (U+0112) , ē (U+0113)
    Ū (U+016A) , ū (U+016B)
    Ḥ (U+0048+0323) , ḥ (U+0068+0323)
    Ṭ (U+0054+0323) , ṭ (U+0074+0323)
    Ī (U+012A) , ī (U+012B)
    Ṣ (U+0053+0323) , ṣ (U+0073+0323)

  - The Romanization column shows only lowercase forms but, when
    romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should
    be used.

    # of reading’) ālap(ܐ), yōd (ܝ) a nd w āw (ܘ), that function both as
    # consonants and vowels, or by pointingmarks appearing above or below
    # other letters. The pointing marks are, however, frequently omitted.
